This little coding exercise involves two different data types as far as variables go: (1) strings (for which I added a header library called <string> by typing #include <string> above the main function 
entry point and just below #include <iostream> for using the standard C++ library for inputs and outputs, creating endlines and new spaces, etc.
I demonstarted how I made the variable declarations as int (integer) data types as the values were both 3 digit round integers. I then converted them to strings so I could use string concatenation. 
I used the function, which is a part of the standard libray syntax as well std::to_string(variable name) using the variable name of the integer I wanted to convert to a string. 
I did this for two different variable names that held integer values both, and after the function, std::to_string(), they both became strings.
I then used the String Concatenation technique which involves adding (using the + operator) more than one string variable together to "string together" a sentence, as strings are largely used for text and making statements
or declarations to output to the screen. My example is pretty simple, but it also demonstrates all of these concepts and functions together in one simple example. 
I used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 on a windows operating system. Thanks for your interest! Please follow me as I am continually putting up my work -
I am about to enter Game Programming and Development essentials courses (The intro part of the career certification for game development foundations) as a online student at CGSpectrum, a highly recognised school as one of the best online game development, VFX and animation schools in the world with high rates of employability for graduates. 
One of the key reasons for this reputation is that all CG Spectrum courses are supported by industry experts, 
with many currently employed at AAA studios around the globe. With a focus on specialisation, the learning pathways included in the highly successful short course offerings have functioned to produce skilled, confident and professional graduates who are industry-ready.
